BUILDING PROCESS
Creating a responsive and accessible QR code component involves several steps. Here's a detailed overview of the building process, from setting up the project to implementing and testing the design.

1. Setting Up the Project
Start by creating the necessary files and folders for the project:

HTML file: index.html

CSS file: style.css

Image folder: images/ (to store the QR code image)

Favicon: favicon-32x32.png


2. Structuring the HTML
The HTML file should contain the basic structure of the QR code component.
3. Styling with CSS
The CSS file, style.css, defines the styles for the component. Here are the steps and considerations for styling:

 a. Setting Global Styles
Define global styles for the body to ensure a consistent look and feel

 b.Styling the Container
Style the main container to ensure it is responsive and visually appealing

 c.Styling the Image
Ensure the QR code image is responsive and fits well within the container

d.Styling Text Elements
Define styles for the headings and the attribute links to ensure readability and proper contrast

e. Adding Media Queries
Use media queries to ensure the container's width adjusts appropriately on larger screens

4. Testing for Responsiveness and Accessibility
Finally, test the design on various devices and screen sizes (from 320px to large screens) to ensure it is responsive. Use tools like Chrome DevTools to simulate different screen sizes and devices.

Additionally, use accessibility tools and checklists to ensure the component meets WCAG requirements, such as:

Contrast Ratios: Ensure text has sufficient contrast against the background.
Alt Text: Provide meaningful alt text for images.
Scalable Units: Use rem and percentage units for better scalability.
Keyboard Navigation: Ensure the component is navigable using a keyboard.
Conclusion
By following these steps, you can create a responsive and accessible QR code component that adapts well to different screen sizes and meets WCAG requirements. This process involves careful planning, styling, and testing to ensure a high-quality, user-friendly design.

PROGRAMMING LANNGUAGE USED

1.HTML

2.CSS

WHAT I LEARNED
Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of responsive web design and accessibility principles. Specifically, I learned how to:

1.Implement Responsive Design: By using flexible layout techniques, such as percentage widths and media queries, I ensured that the QR code component adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

2.Improve Accessibility: By adhering to WCAG guidelines, I made sure that the content is accessible to all users, including those using screen readers. This included providing meaningful alt text for images and ensuring sufficient color contrast for readability.

3.Utilize Web Fonts: I integrated the Google Fonts API to use the 'Outfit' font family, enhancing the visual appeal and readability of the text.

4.Host Projects with GitHub Pages: I learned how to efficiently deploy and host a static website using GitHub Pages, making it accessible online with minimal effort

CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT
Moving forward, I plan to expand my skills in several areas:

1.Advanced CSS Techniques: Delve deeper into CSS Grid and Flexbox to create more complex layouts and improve the overall design process.

2.JavaScript Integration: Enhance the interactivity of future projects by integrating JavaScript, allowing for dynamic content and improved user experiences.

3.Performance Optimization: Focus on optimizing web performance by minimizing load times and ensuring efficient resource use, particularly for mobile devices.

4.Accessibility Best Practices: Continuously update my knowledge of accessibility standards and implement best practices to ensure all my projects are inclusive and user-friendly.

USEFUL RESOURCES
Several resources were particularly helpful in completing this project:

1.MDN Web Docs: An invaluable resource for web development, providing comprehensive documentation and tutorials on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

2.Google Fonts: Easy integration of web fonts, which helped me use the 'Outfit' font family in the project.

3.Frontend Mentor: A platform offering real-world projects to improve coding skills, where I found the QR code component challenge

4.A11Y Project: A great resource for learning about web accessibility and ensuring my projects meet WCAG standards.
