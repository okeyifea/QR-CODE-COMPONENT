BUILDING PROCESS
Creating a responsive and accessible QR code component involves several steps. Here's a detailed overview of the building process, from setting up the project to implementing and testing the design.

1. Setting Up the Project
Start by creating the necessary files and folders for the project:

HTML file: index.html
CSS file: style.css
Image folder: images/ (to store the QR code image)
Favicon: favicon-32x32.png
2. Structuring the HTML
The HTML file should contain the basic structure of the QR code component.
3. Styling with CSS
The CSS file, style.css, defines the styles for the component. Here are the steps and considerations for styling:

a. Setting Global Styles
Define global styles for the body to ensure a consistent look and feel
b.Styling the Container
Style the main container to ensure it is responsive and visually appealing
c.Styling the Image
Ensure the QR code image is responsive and fits well within the container
d.Styling Text Elements
Define styles for the headings and the attribute links to ensure readability and proper contrast
e. Adding Media Queries
Use media queries to ensure the container's width adjusts appropriately on larger screens
4. Testing for Responsiveness and Accessibility
Finally, test the design on various devices and screen sizes (from 320px to large screens) to ensure it is responsive. Use tools like Chrome DevTools to simulate different screen sizes and devices.

Additionally, use accessibility tools and checklists to ensure the component meets WCAG requirements, such as:

Contrast Ratios: Ensure text has sufficient contrast against the background.
Alt Text: Provide meaningful alt text for images.
Scalable Units: Use rem and percentage units for better scalability.
Keyboard Navigation: Ensure the component is navigable using a keyboard.
Conclusion
By following these steps, you can create a responsive and accessible QR code component that adapts well to different screen sizes and meets WCAG requirements. This process involves careful planning, styling, and testing to ensure a high-quality, user-friendly design.
